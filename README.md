**Transport Management System**

To begin with, users will be shown the names of three types of vehicles after entering the web page. After that, seven main pieces of information about that vehicle can be displayed by clicking on each vehicle’s name. They are a photo of the vehicle, license plate number, vehicle ID, driver's name, phone number, where the vehicle is delivering the goods to, a map to find the area, and details about the amount charged for one kilometer. If a driver enters here, he can enter information about his vehicle and should upload the vehicle’s image, if it is one of the three vehicles available on the web page, and update and delete it when necessary. Finally, he will be able to get a report in PDF format by entering details about the transport facilities available there.

**Admin Vehicle Modification Criteria**: Entering data and information related to the photos and details of the three vehicles in Transport Management, their vehicle number, vehicle type, driver details, delivery areas, and delivery prices, etc., searching for updates and details and deleting them when necessary. Posting is done by the admin.

**Vehicle System Creation Criteria**: The admin will upload three types of vehicles required for bulk delivery along with their images in the system. After that, data is added to the system about seven grant information that is important to the customers.

**MERN_STACK**
.
MERN is an acronym that stands for MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. It is a popular web development stack used to build full-stack JavaScript applications. Each component of the MERN stack serves a specific purpose:

MongoDB: MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format called BSON (Binary JSON). It provides scalability, high performance, and schema flexibility, making it suitable for handling large volumes of data.

Express.js: Express.js is a lightweight web application framework for Node.js. It simplifies the process of building web applications and APIs by providing a set of robust features and middleware. Express.js handles routing, middleware management, and server-side logic.

React: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It enables the creation of interactive and reusable UI components. React uses a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) to efficiently update and render components, resulting in a fast and responsive user interface.
Node.js: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine. It allows JavaScript to run on the server-side, enabling the development of server applications using JavaScript. Node.js provides an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it efficient and scalable.
